		<p1>I used the provided template as a base for my structure however I constantly add slight changes in style as my idea evolves.
<br>Also, I am currently playing with some different design ideas and colour schemas that are constantly evolving through re-exploring more and more ideas in HTML. 
<br>In order to provide proof that I understand the basic usage of page styling in HTML, I coloured and changed the font size on the Under Construction page and Homepage. </p1>
